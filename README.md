WARRIOR'S CUSTOM MADE VERTIGO 2 MODS
=
this is my github page for any custom-made mods I make for Vertigo 2.
this can range from sily mods, to scary mods, and to even sometimes difficult mods.

Melonloader is REQUIRED for any mods that you find here, or for until i make a custom mod loader for Vertigo games
(although this may come much later, or not at all.)

[vertigo 2 discord](https://discord.gg/nGjNJWZtef)

there is currently a few mods (if you cant find it in the releases tab, it is still wip and unreleased.)


No Manual Reload--
=
no manual reload essentially removes your ammo belt so you cant reload


"how am i supposed to reload then?"

thanks to vertigo 2's built-in automatic reload system, this is literally the only way you will be able to reload

Shuffle Levels--
=
shuffle levels makes it so that you literally cant choose what level you go to


"what do you mean?"

every time you click on any button to go to any level, it chooses a random scene, and loads that instead of the one you were trying to load.

Fucked Gremlins--
=
makes all gremlins upside-down and the boat gremlin on chapter 9 literally have a stroke lmao

--
=
GOTTAGO 2--
=
(the name is meant to rhyme with vertigo 2 lmao)
this mod essentially just makes the game complete mayhem.
such as:

revolver has 1000 bullets and shoots 100 times per second

all guns have x4 recoil

DO NOT PUT A HAT ON

nani doesnt talk

cleaning bots jump around

taking a photo on a smartphone crashes your game

all gremlins are scarily fast

AND MUCH MORE

(around 25 more to be more precise)

(MIX WITH FUCKED GREMLINS MOD TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE MAYHEMIC!!!)
